# Trajectory-optimization-and-stability-analysis

Mathematical modeling of the glider's trajectory using governing equations of flight mechanics and dynamic soaring. 

Trajectories are optimized using the matlab solver based on Gauss pseudospectral method.

Furthermore, the optimized trajectories are analyzed for the stability using Floquet theory.
